        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          For this project, I used the p5.js library to create visualizations, graphics, and other
          creative sketches. This library has a range of functionalities and I created six different
          types of sketches to demonstrate a snippet of the capabilities p5.js has to offer.

          Each sketch I created stands alone, but some are inspirations of each other. I enjoy using
          geometric shapes to create patterned sketches. The majority of my sketches are based on
          equations that I defined in code.

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <p>
          The learning curve of the p5.js library was a little steep. While it was simple to understand
          the basic functions and structure of how the library runs functionally, the different options
          that are available made it fun yet challenging as I tried different ideas.

          With six different sketches created in p5.js that increased in complexity, the official reference
          was my guide. In addition, I watched the Code Train on YouTube to help further understand
          some ideas that were not familiar to me with the library or otherwise (ie mathematics, audio analysis).

          Like I mentioned previously, I am a big fan of geometry and patterns. I used a circle as the basis
          for most of my sketches I produced, adding on layers of complexity as I expanded to using different
          methods.

          I went through many iterations for my last sketch, the one I am most proud of. The audio analysis
          (the p5.sound.js) library was very useful as I was able to extract information from audio files
          on my laptop. This was really fun for me to make and I enjoyed the entire process of it.

          Below is an image of my unfinished sixth sketch:

          Because I coded patterns, the mathematics was difficult to figure out and wrap my head around.
          However, I was able to experiment and play around with different equations that took into account
          dynamic screen dimensions to create a general version of an audio visualizer.

        <h2>Issue Deep Dive</h2>
        <p>
          The most difficult part of this project was figuring out how to use the p5.sound library.
          It was the coolest and most challenging aspect. There were a lot of jargon such as 'amplitude',
          'Hertz', etc., that I had to search up and understand so that I could use these terms to create
          a viusal design of sorts.

          Since I'm not an expert at all, I followed YouTube tutorials to gain a basic understanding
          of how to use the p5.sound library and from there, I was able to play around on my own and create
          an audio visualizer that I fully personalized.

        <h2>Future Ideas</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Analyzing audio based on audio range (ie bass, mid, treble, etc.,)</li>
          <li>Visualizing audio based on audio range (ie bass, mid, treble, etc.,)</li>
          <li>Implementing a simple UI that explains the audio visualizer and includes instructions</li>
        </ul>
