      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        My first step was to map out the page directory of my site. I started with
        the Home page and then linked my About Me and Cheatsheet pages. Once I had
        the barebones of my site, I was able to embellish the details with CSS.

        Right now, I'm in the process of decorating my site and expanding it
        beyond its basic functionalities and requirements.

      <h2>Issue</h2>
      <p>
        One issue that I had with hosting my site through GitHub and ensuring that
        the proper version was the one that was being displayed on my URL.

      <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
      <p>
        I chose to do a hover box shadow transition because it is subtle. I added
        a 'hover' state property in my style.css file.

      <h2>Future Ideas</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding a night and dark mode with Javascript</li>
        <li>Adding accents and colors to bring more character to my site</li>
        <li>Adding a fun landing/cover element</li>
