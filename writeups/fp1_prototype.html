    <h1>FP1: Final Project Writeup</h1>

    <a href="https://github.com/audreyqiu2/AUDiovisualizer-prototype"><p>Here is the link to the Github repo for my prototype</p></a>
    <p>Unfortuantely, there are some issues and I'm not able to build and deploy my project through Github currently</p>
    <section>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        As a prototype, it is not really able to be run while hosted in Github.
        Due to some work-in-progress aspects of my code and some of the external
        dependencies that come with the Spotify API.

        Every time it the user clicks on the login button, it goes to an error
        and is unable to access the rest of the application.

      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <p>
        I was building off of my creative sketch from one of the previous assignemnts.
        I was already very happy with the audiovisualizer from that assignment so I decided
        to start with tackling accessing and making calls to the Spotify API. This was very challenging
        and it took up a lot more time that I originally expected it to.

        At this point, I was still in the process of figuring out how to access specific tokens
        and pass it between the client and server side.

      <h2>Issue</h2>
      <p>
        One issue that I had with hosting my site through GitHub and ensuring that
        the proper version was the one that was being displayed on my URL.

        Another big issue was using and familiarizing myself with accessing the Spotify API and
        reorienting myself to getting used to APIs in general: fetch, express, and other libraries and
        packages that i would need.

        At this point, I was stuck on retreiving the access token from the server side code to be able
        to create an instance of a Spotify Web Player object that lives client-side. I have been utilizing
        ChatGPT, the Spotify API documentation, and web searches to search for solutions.

      <h2>Ideas & Future Ideas</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Having different color themes</li>
        <li>Showing more information about playback</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Project Scope</h2>
      <p>
        My project scope has been almost the same but it definitely is narrower
        than it was originally. I was a little ambitious and given the deadline constraints
        it was difficult to really build out what I wanted to the extent that I
        originally expected.

      <h2>Time Management</h2>
      <p>
        I underestimated the time that it would take for me to work on this project
        prototype. I think the biggest roadblock was having refamiliarize myself with
        how to access APIs, the client and server side interactions, and the Spotify API
        itself--which is a lot more complex than the other APIs that I have used
        in the past.

      <h2>Implementation Plan</h2>
      <p>
        My implementation plan is not really changed. I'm going to continue working
        on the Spotify API integration and then I'm going to focus on the UI elements
        as well as integrating the p5 sound library to display the visuals.
