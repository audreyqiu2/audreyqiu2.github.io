    <h1>FP0: Final Project Proposal</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Project Concept</h2>
      <p>
        My project is a customizable audio visualizer that converts the audio input into visuals.

      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <h3>Prototype</h3>
      <p>
        The prototype of my app will have the desired customizable UI elements and menu that the user
        will be able to select and change. The user will be able to change display options (light or dark)
        and theme of the overall layout.

        In addition, it will allow audio input from the microphone on the device or a specified device.
      </p>
      <h3>Final Version</h3>
      <p>
        The final version of my app will have the core functionalities mentioned in the prototype Description
        with a more fleshed out and detailed user interface for the application.
      </p>

      <h2>Development Plan</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Research APIs and other technologies that I would need to be able to source music from</li>
        <li>Make a flowchart diagram for the logic that will dictate the behavior of the back-end</li>
        <li>Finalize the design of the UI and its variations</li>
        <li>Code the darn thing</li>
        <li>Debug and fix any changes</li>
        <li>Work towards stretch goals (see below)</li>
      </ol>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Known Unknowns</h2>
      <p>
        Some things that I don't know at the moment is how to include different audio inputs. For example,
        if the audio is not physically playing in the room, or if it's a file, how would that be different.
        Additionally, if I'm using an API for music files, how would that differ from just having local mp3
        files in the project package.
      </p>

      <h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Time permitting, my application will include Spotify integration and allow users to sign in to their account to directly use the
        application as an audio source.
