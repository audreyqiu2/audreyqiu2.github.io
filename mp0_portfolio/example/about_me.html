    <p>
      I'm a senior studying Human Centered Design and Engineering at the
      Univeristy of Washington. I'm pursuing a career in UX Design and I'm also
      a freelance UI/UX designer on the side.

      Some things that I enjoy outside of my studies and career include:
      hiking, snowboarding/skiing, music, cooking, travelling, and watching
      movies.
