    <h1>MP0: Portfolio Site</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      My first step was to map out the page directory of my site. I started with
      the Home page and then linked my About Me and Cheatsheet pages. Once I had
      the barebones of my site, I was able to embellish the details with CSS.

      Right now, I'm in the process of decorating my site and expanding it
      beyond its basic functionalities and requirements.

    <h2>Issue</h2>
    <p>
      One issue that I had with hosting my site through GitHub and ensuring that
      the proper version was the one that was being displayed on my URL.

    <h2>CSS Transition</h2>
    <p>
      I chose to do a hover transition because it is subtle. I added a 'hover'
      state property in my style.css file.

      I'm a senior studying Human Centered Design and Engineering at the
      Univeristy of Washington. I'm pursuing a career in UX Design and I'm also
      a freelance UI/UX designer on the side.
